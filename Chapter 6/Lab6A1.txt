# Title:    Lab6A1
# Author:   Nicholas Arvo
# Purpose:  This program will read in lines from a file containing the number of
#           sides a shape has and the length of the equal sides. Using this information it 
#           will determine the corresponding geometric shape and calculate the area.

    area = (3*sqrt(3)*(length ** 2))/2
    print("Shape Hexagon\nArea: " + "%0.2f"%area)

def octagon(length):
    # Area of Octagon = 2(x^2)(1 + sqrt(2)
    area = (2 * (length ** 2)) * (1 + sqrt(2))
