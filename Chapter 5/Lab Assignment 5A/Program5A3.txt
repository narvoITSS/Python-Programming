# Title:        Program5A3
# Author:       Nicholas Arvo
# Purpose:      This program reads a sequence of numbers from a file and
#               determines if the values in this sequence are always going up
#               or always going down.

# Determine if successive values are always increasing or decreasing
# two count variables, for a series to be always increasing should be equal to length - 1
